## Introduction

This repository provides a solid foundation for building a modern web application using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js for server-side JavaScript. Additionally, it implements token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure your application's endpoints and user data.

## Features

- **MERN Stack**: Utilize the power of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to build a full-stack web application.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens to protect sensitive user data and APIs.
- **Scalable Structure**: Benefit from a well-organized project structure that promotes maintainability and extensibility.
- **API Endpoints**: Set up API routes that handle user registration, login, and other application-specific functionality.
- **Frontend UI**: Leverage React components and state management to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
